# District_PGI
District Performance Grading Index (PGI) Analysis - India - ( 2021-2022 )

# Discripation 
•	This Project analyses ( PGI ) data for India for the year 2021-2022

•	The PGI accesses the Performance of school education at the district level across various category, learning outcome, effective classroom, transactions etc,..

•	This analysis aims to identify hight-performing and low-performing state and district.

•	To uncover patterns and trends in the data it can assist improvement quality of school education across India.

# Data set:
https://github.com/JMK-26/District_PGI/blob/d32dbb1255da088ebb0b2e1be3083f2a78a0e6f2/District_PGI_Data_Set.csv

 # Qustions 
1.	Which state have highest and lowest performing district overall ?

2.	Which category contributes the most to the overall district score ?

3.	Are there any patterns in district Grades (Uttam , etc) based on the scores ?

4.	Which state have the most consistently hight-performance district ?

5.	How has district performances varies across different category ( outcome, ETC,etc,. )   ?

•	Visualization were created using matplotilb and seaborn to hightlight.

•	Analysis focused on identify Top performance and key contributing factors.

# finel conclusion
